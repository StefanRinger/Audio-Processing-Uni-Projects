# Audio-Processing-Uni-Projects
A Collection of Notebooks that I created in a lab course at the FAU University offered by the audio labs chair.

## Table of contents:
- 1 STFT: Covers the basics of short time fourier transformation all the way up to pitch extraction that is mapped to musical notes
- 2 Speech Enhancement: Covers different approaches to beamforming ranging from a simple sum and delay concept to signal dependent methods
- 3 Stastical methods: Unlike the other topics this is coded in R. With statistcial methods like the boxplot, t-test, Q-Q plots and ANOVA we try to answer the question which coder is the best given some voting results of expert and non-professional listeners
- 4 Convolution: Covers methods to implement the convolution operator both efficiently and blockbased. We explore speeding up with FFT and OLS + OLA. At the end we use these tools to estimate the (fractional) lag between two timeseries.
- 5 Speech analysis: We investigate the physiological creation of speech and use this model to derive effective speech coding methods (filters).


Please note: Parts of the code were already given by the audiolabs chair. I do not claim total ownership of the material. The code may not be completed and will not be maintained. I take zero responsibility for broken code.
